# UFO SIGHTINGS
#### **THE _TRUTH_ IS OUT THERE**

## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
The purpose of the UFO Website project was to take a large collection of data and turn it into a user friendly website. The collected data was various UFO sightings from different locations. We used this data to create a website where UFO enthusiasts (or skeptics) could log on and filter the data based off their desired search criteria. A simple webite layout was storyboarded before we began to make writing our code easier but also to give us a proper idea of what the finished project would be.

## RESULTS
The website is easy to navigate as all the information is on the main page. When you access the website, there is a brief summary of the goal of the website followed by a list of all the collected UFO sightings. Users are welcome to browse through the list as is. However, a detailed search filter is available if they want to find specific sightings.

Once the user decides how they'd like to filter the data, they just enter the search criteria into the box and hit enter on their keyboard. The website will then show the filtered results, if there are any in that criteria. Here is an example of what the filtered data will look like. I searched for UFO sightings in Alabama and receieved one result in Madison. To clear the filters, the user would just need to erase what they typed and hit enter on their keyboard again.

## SUMMARY
The website design is simple and served the purpose for what the client wanted. One drawback is when you search by state, you cannot type the full state name and receive results. The user has to type the specific state abbreviation to see the results for the specific state. One way the website could be improved would be to create a scrollable box that the unfiltered data would be displayed in to avoid having to scroll to the bottom of the page. The information could be displayed on one screen as opposed to the website being a long list with empty space on the lefthand side of the page. Another recommendation would be to have drop down filters at the top of the data table to filter that data not only by date order, but in order of any of the header categories. For example, you could filter by shape, but still see all of the shapes listed but grouped together by particular shape.
