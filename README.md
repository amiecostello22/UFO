# UFO SIGHTINGS
### **THE _TRUTH_ IS OUT THERE**

# OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
The purpose of the UFO Website project was to take a large collection of data and turn it into a user friendly website. The collected data was various UFO sightings from different locations. We used this data to create a website where UFO enthusiasts (or skeptics) could log on and filter the data based off their desired search criteria. A simple webite layout was storyboarded before we began to make writing our code easier but also to give us a proper idea of what the finished project would be.
